August 2015: The "Crisis" in Psychology
===============================================================================
left: 50%

[Open Science Collaboration (2015)][osf2015] tries to replicate 100 studies
published in 3 psychology different journals in 2008.

***

- Boil a study down to 1 test statistic and 1 effect size.
  - Compare replication's test and effect size against original.
- Approximately 36% of the studies are replicated (same test statistic.
- On average, effect sizes in replications are half that of the original
  studies.

Reactions
===============================================================================

We're doomed.

![You sit on a throne of lies!](./assets/throne-of-lies.gif)

Most findings are probably false.

***

No, this is business as usual.

![Busy body penguin with a hat and briefcase](./assets/business-as-usual.gif)

Any credible discipline has to do this kind of house-cleaning from time to time.




Lots of hand-wringing and soul-searching
===============================================================================

Some reactionary:

- Replication creates an [industry for incompetent hacks][replication-hacks].
- Here come the [methodological terrorists][method-terrorists]!

![dumpster fire dot gif](./assets/dumpster-fire.gif)

***

Some constructive:

- [Everything is f'ed][everything-fucked] -- so what else is new?
- Increased rigor and openness are [a good thing][repeat-after-me].

I'm in the business-as-usual camp, by the way
===============================================================================

Better research practices are catching on.

- Pre-registration
- Power analyses and [other foresight][stats-autopsy].
- Meta-analytic tools to assess the health of a field
- Better disclosure of other unanalyzed measurements

Crisis made me think more of questionable data analysis practices
===============================================================================

Basically, unintentional acts and rituals to appease Statistical Significance
gods.

- HARKing (hypothesizing after results are known)
  - Telling a story to fit the data.
- Garden of forking data
  - Conducting countless sub-tests and sub-analyses on the data
- p-hacking
  - Doing these tests in order to find a significant effect.
- Selective reporting
  - Reporting only the tests that yielded a significant result.




My response to the crisis
===============================================================================

I want to avoid these errors.

- I want to level up my stats and explore new techniques.
  - Maybe more robust estimation techniques
  - Maybe machine learning techniques to complement conventional analyses.
- I want something less finicky than statistical significance.
  - p-values don't mean what many people think they mean.
  - Neither do confidence intervals.
  - Statistical significance is not related to practical significance.




December 2015
===============================================================================

- I started reading the Gelman and Hill book.
  - This is the book for [the `arm` package][arm].
- It emphasizes estimation, uncertainty and simulation.
- Midway through, the book pivots to Bayesian estimation.
- I roll with it.

Using ARM
===============================================================================
title: false

I try to download the example BUGS scripts, but they are no longer supported.

Instead, I find [a page with the title][use-stan]:

> ### Use Stan instead.

<br/>
Okay, I'll give it try...

January 2016
===============================================================================

I'm down a rabbit hole, writing Stan models to fit the models from the ARM
book, and there is an influx of Bayesian tools for R.

- [Statistical Rethinking][rethinking], a book that reteaches regression from a
  Bayesian perspective with R and Stan, is released.
- New version of [brms][brms] is released. This package converts R model code
  into Stan programs.
- [RStanARM][rstanarm] is released.
- This blog post circulates: ["R Users Will Now Inevitably Become Bayesians"]
  [we-r-bayesians].

I eat all this up. I become a convert.

Long story short
===============================================================================

The replication crisis sparked my curiosity, and a wave of new tools and
resources made it really easy to get started with Bayesian stats.

No formal coursework. I learned about the math/statistics from playing with
code.

My goal with these toosl has been to make better, more honest scientific
summaries of observed data.
